# AncientStore  App

Hey there! Welcome to the **AncientStore** project, built with **Qwik** and **Qwik City**. This app displays a list of products (fetched via GraphQL) and lets users add or remove items from their wishlist. The wishlist is stored in localStorage, so it stays persistent between page reloads.
